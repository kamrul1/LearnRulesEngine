This is a [behavioral design pattern](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/behavioral-patterns) and is 
used to model behaviour of a part of a system.

## Problem Rules Engines solve
  
Eliminate complex conditional logic into modular/maintainable code

## Apply the Rules Engine pattern

**Engine Part** - processes the rules and applies them to produce a result

**Rules Part** - multiple parts that describe the condition, are usually grouped together


# Defining Rules

> Each rule should follow single responsiblity principle
> Rules are managed using an engine that chooses which rule(s) to apply
> Rules may be ordered, aggregated, or filtered as appropriate
